                    When I joined, I didn't expect it to be this intense. The training was intensive, 
                    they didn't keep us on the surface they were digging deep into the course.
                     The last few weeks were really tasking for me and I wasn't expecting much volume of work,
                      I was really surprised by it all.
                     I honestly appreciate Youlead and I promise to put all I have learnt to work.</p>
